# /gauntlet-commit $ARGUMENTS

Commit with optional gauntlet validation. Runs `agent-gauntlet detect` first, validates based on intent (full run, checks only, or skip), handles failures, then commits.

## Step 1 - Detect Changes

Run `agent-gauntlet detect` using `Bash`:

```bash
agent-gauntlet detect 2>&1; echo "DETECT_EXIT:$?"
```

Check the exit code from the `DETECT_EXIT:` line:

- **Exit 0** → gates would run, continue to Step 2
- **Exit 2** → no gates would run (no changes or no applicable gates), **skip to Step 4** (commit directly)
- **Exit 1** → error, report the error to the user and stop

## Step 2 - Determine Validation Intent

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for a validation intent. Do not prompt the user if a clear intent is found.

| ARGUMENTS pattern | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| Contains "run", "full", or "all gates" | Invoke `/gauntlet-run` (Step 3a) |
| Contains "check" or "checks" | Invoke `/gauntlet-check` (Step 3b) |
| Contains "skip" | Run `agent-gauntlet skip 2>&1` (Step 3c), then go to Step 4 |
| Empty or no clear intent | Present the three choices below to the user, wait for selection |

**When prompting the user**, present these choices:

1. **Run all gates** — full validation (checks + reviews)
2. **Run checks only** — checks without AI reviews
3. **Skip gauntlet** — advance baseline without running any gates

Then proceed to the step matching the user's selection.

## Step 3a - Full Validation (gauntlet-run)

Invoke `/gauntlet-run`.

- If it passes → go to Step 4
- If it fails → the `/gauntlet-run` skill handles fixing and re-running. After that skill completes, ask the user: **"Ready to commit?"**. Proceed to Step 4 only on confirmation.

## Step 3b - Checks-Only Validation (gauntlet-check)

Invoke `/gauntlet-check`.

- If it passes → go to Step 4
- If it fails → the `/gauntlet-check` skill handles fixing and re-running. After that skill completes, ask the user: **"Ready to commit?"**. Proceed to Step 4 only on confirmation.

## Step 3c - Skip Validation

Run:

```bash
agent-gauntlet skip 2>&1
```

Report the command output to the user, then go to Step 4.

## Step 4 - Commit

Check whether you have a skill for committing git changes available (excluding `gauntlet-commit` itself to avoid self-invocation).

- **If a commit skill is found** → invoke that skill to perform the commit
- **If no commit skill is found** → stage all tracked changes, propose a commit message following the conventional commits format (`<type>: <description>`), then run `git commit -m "<message>"`
